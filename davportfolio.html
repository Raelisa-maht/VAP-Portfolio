        <h1>DAV - Sales analysis by product dashboard</h1>
        <h3>Project Background</h3>
        <p>Northwind Traders imports and exports speciality food around the world. It is looking 
          at expanding its business. Before deciding on their expansion plan, their management 
          would like to understand more about their current sales analyse in terms of products, 
          employees, suppliers, customers, and inventory. Your team has been tasked to develop 
          reports to show your analysis and explain your approach to the expansion.</p>
        <h3>My role and solution</h3>
        <p>My role in this project was to develop the POWER BI Sales Analysis by Product dashboard. 
          I took on the task of designing and implementing the reporting solution to provide insights into our sales performance by product. 
          This involved gathering requirements from stakeholders, preparing and modeling the data, designing the dashboard layout, 
          implementing features for interactivity, and ensuring the accuracy and usability of the dashboard.</p>
