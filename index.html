        <h2>üôãüèª Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm thrilled to introduce myself as a first-year student in the Diploma of Applied AI and Analytics program at Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP), with a passion for UX design, Power BI, and continuous learning. 
          My academic journey is complemented by a series of online courses from platforms like Codecademy, Coursera, and Great Learning, where I've honed my skills in various aspects of technology and data analytics. 
          Through my portfolio, I aim to showcase not only my academic pursuits but also my dedication to lifelong learning and professional development.
        </p>
        <h2>üìñ Education</h2>
        <p>
          My academic journey at NYP has provided me with a comprehensive foundation in AI, analytics, and UX design. 
          Throughout my coursework, I have completed a range of modules tailored to these domains. Modules such as "Business Need Analysis," "UXD," and "Decision Analysis" have deepened my understanding of user-centric design principles and data-driven decision-making methodologies. 
          Furthermore, coursework in "Data Modelling," "Data Storage Administration," and "Data Visualisation" has equipped me with the technical skills needed to manipulate and analyse vast datasets effectively. 
          These modules, along with specialized courses like "Applied Cryptography" and "Statistical Research Method," have broadened my knowledge and enhanced my ability to tackle complex challenges in real-world scenarios.
