        <h1>VAP - Visualizing Singapore's Green Plan 2030 Dashboard</h1>
        <h3>Project Background</h3>
        <p> The Singapore Green Plan 2030, introduced by the Government in February 2021, is a holistic initiative aimed at driving sustainable development across the nation. 
            Comprising five key pillars—City in Nature, Energy Reset, Sustainable Living, Green Economy, and Resilient Future—the plan is championed by multiple ministries. With a focus on sustainability, the project aims to assess and visualize progress in areas such as green environment, sustainable transportation, food security, and waste reduction. 
            Through data visualization and analysis, it seeks to showcase Singapore's commitment to a sustainable future.</p>
        <h3>My role and solution</h3>
        <p> In the Energy Reset pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, I'm tasked with creating a data visualization report on Singapore's sustainable energy efforts. 
            I'll use Microsoft Power BI to develop interactive dashboards showcasing progress in renewable energy adoption, energy efficiency, and carbon emissions reduction. 
            By employing ETL techniques and statistical analysis, my goal is to provide clear insights into Singapore's commitment to sustainable energy practices.</p>
